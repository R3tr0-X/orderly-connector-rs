# Orderly Connector Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating Orderly Network into the Smart Order Router (SOR) service. The implementation will use the `orderly-connector-rs` SDK, with additional extensions to support advanced order types and WebSocket integration.

## Project Goals

## Implementation Details

### AlgoOrderType Implementation

Algo orders in Orderly include:

- `StopMarket`: Execute market order when price reaches trigger
- `StopLimit`: Place limit order when price reaches trigger
- `TakeProfitMarket`: Market order at profit target
- `TakeProfitLimit`: Limit order at profit target
- `TrailingStop`: Moving stop-loss that follows price movements

### WebSocket Integration

The WebSocket integration will:

1. Subscribe to public market data for all supported symbols
2. Create user-specific private WebSocket connections on demand
3. Process updates in dedicated async tasks
4. Maintain cache of latest market data
5. Implement automatic reconnection with backoff

### Error Handling Strategy

1. Map Orderly API error codes to meaningful messages
2. Implement retry for transient errors (network, timeout, rate limit)
3. Log detailed error information including stack traces
4. Provide context-specific error messages to clients

## Success Criteria

1. All Orderly API endpoints properly integrated into SOR
2. Algo orders working correctly with proper validation
3. Real-time updates via WebSockets with reconnection
4. Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
5. Documented API with examples
6. Performance benchmarks meeting latency targets (<100ms median)
